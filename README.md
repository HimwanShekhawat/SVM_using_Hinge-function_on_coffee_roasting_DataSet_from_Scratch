# SVM_using_Hinge-function_on_coffee_roasting_DataSet_from_Scratch
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier from scratch using NumPy. It classifies synthetic coffee roasting data with polynomial feature expansion (degree 2).

## Features

- Generates synthetic binary classification data
- Normalizes inputs
- Expands features to include polynomial terms
- Trains SVM using hinge loss minimization
- Plots decision boundaries and training cost over epochs

## How to Run
